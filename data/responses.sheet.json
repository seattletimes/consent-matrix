I was probably around 11 or 12 years old when I learned what rape was, which I likely learned from the Internet (I was born in 1993), and I knew that it meant forcing someone to have sex with you, and that it was a crime. My parents and teachers talked about saying \"no\" and telling an adult if someone made you do something inappropriate. Parents and teachers only talked to me about the very worst case scenarios - rape, being drugged, or being molested by an adult. Everything else, I learned through friends, reading about things on the Internet, and seeing things play out in movies/TV. It was only in the last few years that I, now almost 25, began to understand consent fully. These realizations came after being in a relationship in which I oftentimes did not give consent, but at the time I didn't think I could be assaulted because I was in a relationship with the person who assaulted me. I thought that because we cared about each other and that I had wanted to be sexual in other situations, the times when I resisted or said no \"didn't count\" as assault. ",

Then I learned about the concept of rape when I was older, but it seemed like something that only happened to randoms in a park. Then in high school I learned about domestic rape. At college orientation I learned that for someone to consent, he or she must be sober. As a member of a fraternity, I attended multiple seminars that reinforced what consent is and to make sure you’ve received/given it. So it’s not just a talk that you sit down a child at one age and tell them everything. Sure, I should have learned the sober thing before college, but it wouldn’t have made as much sense to me as a fifth-grader. Like learning about sex itself, it’s an ongoing discussion.",

It was understood as something that related to sexual contact only, and it wasn't seen as something that determined the morality of interaction between adults, as there were plenty of situations where sex was immoral regardless of consent. So it wasn't seen as something worth discussing. As I grew older and transitioned away from that mindset I began to discover how little I actually knew about the subject, and more contact with queer, polyamorous, and kink/BDSM communities provided me with an education on consent and its application to non-sexual relationships and interactions as well, and a lot of that knowledge came as recently as this year.",

The discomfort and anxiety of the adults (our teachers and parents) was palpable, and what I took with me from that lesson was mostly fear and confusion about what kind of touch was “OK” and what wasn’t. As I got older, when people pursued me in ways that felt uncomfortable but weren’t physically aggressive, I had a hard time saying “no” directly (which felt shameful), and when I did express discomfort and the other person didn’t listen or change their behavior, I felt even more ashamed. Based on those early lessons, I concluded that saying \"no\" was not only my right, but my responsibility. If the other person ignored it, that was because I had somehow refused incorrectly. There was also this major gender element to it, especially as I got older. Talks from parents and adult friends started centering on the fact that I was “growing into a woman” and that I needed to be aware of “how boys think” and take preemptive steps to protect myself, including not being alone with boys, not behaving in any way or saying anything that might “give the wrong impression” or “lead someone on.” I’m bisexual and nonbinary, and even though I wasn’t out in high school or college, I knew who I was and what I was about. This gendered dance of pursuit and refusal that everyone seemed to get without much trouble added an additional layer of difficulty to the consent conversation. Now not only did I have to say \"no\" loudly and strongly enough to make someone stop, but also if I wait too long, try to be friends with the wrong kind of person, fail to pick up on social cues, or act in some way that’s not appropriate for the gender I was assigned at birth, it felt like the consequences for saying \"no\" were much higher.",
